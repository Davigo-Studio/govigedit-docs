# Welcome to the Govigedit Docs repo!

## Contributing
The docs are just straight up Markdown files so editing them is as easy as editing the Markdown files and making a Pull Request. 
Note that if you're wanting to add a new page, make sure you also add an entry in `docs/_sidebar.md`.

If you'd like to host the docs on your own machine, you can download [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) and run `docsify serve` in the `docs` folder, and docsify will do the rest. (docsify is what we use for the wiki.)
