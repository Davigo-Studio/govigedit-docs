# Welcome to the Govigedit docs!
Govigedit is a tool that allows users to design and play their own maps for [Davigo, a VR vs. PC battle game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1116540/DAVIGO/). 
More specifically, Govidad, the WIP online prototype. 

Maps are built using [Unity](https://unity.com/). It is **REQUIRED** to use Unity version **2020.3.24**. 
[You can find this version on the Download Archive page](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive). 

Govigedit (and this document) is a work-in-progress and there will be breaking changes leading up to Alpha 3. Here be dragons!

For feedback, bug reporting or feature requests, please join the [Davigo Discord](https://discord.gg/5du5Ack).

Anyway, without further ado, lets [Get started!](getting-started.md)
